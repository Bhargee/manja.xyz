                I am currently a senior undergraduate studying mathematics and
                computer science at the University of Illinois at Urbana
                Champaign. I work with Prof. Tim Bretl's <a href="http://bretl.csl.illinois.edu">
                research group</a> developing autonomous drone systems for
                    construction site monitoring. I am currently doing my
                    undergraduate thesis work with his group, developing 
                    machine learning and machine vision approaches to automatic
                    grip selection for anthropomorphic prosthetic
                    hands. I also work with the <a

                With regards to research, I am generally interested in robotic
                intelligence and autonomy, focusing on vision and learning. I
                have recently become interested in applications of neuroscience
                to artificial intelligence, and am also fascinated with
                programming languages and their implementation. Outside of
                school and research, I enjoy reading, learning the bass,
                biking, and boxing. I am also interested in anti-authoritarian
                and radical politics.
